Installation
============

Not implemented yet.


Usage
=====

Once the plugin is installed, you can simply `Ctrl-click` on any text
that looks like a bug link (such as `JDK-123`) to go directly to the
bug.

You can customize and add additional expressions to be identified as a
link via `Window` -> `Preferences` -> `Bug Reference`.
